Hotel Management System using Python OOP

This is a basic hotel room booking system created to practice Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python

The core logic and system architecture including classes like Room Guest Booking and System were written by me

The graphical user interface using tkinter was added with the help of AI to quickly test the functionality with a simple visual interface

Features

Book and unbook rooms
View all rooms including booked and available
Calculate bill based on number of days
GUI tabs for room booking and viewing all bookings

Notes

The GUI was not hand coded by me It was generated by AI to wrap my logic in a usable interface

Created and structured by Sarva
GUI integration assisted by AI
